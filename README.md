# 🥁 Online Drumkit 🥁

I'm working to create my own version of the drumkit tutorial seen on the JavaScript 30 course.

You can see the website here:  https://cgreen789.github.io/drumKit/

I decided to start from scratch to practice so haven't copied from the files you can find on GitHub.

⏭️ My next task is to add keydown functionality so that you can press the right key to play the sound.

⏭️ I'd also like to add some CSS styling so when you press the right key, the button's border shadow changes and the buttons gets slightly larger.

🤔 Changing the colour of the buttons - what colours would work?
🤔 Other styling on the page?
